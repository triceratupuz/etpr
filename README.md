# Equally Tempered Piano Roll

## What is this

This software has been developed to compose music in equally tempered intonation and with strange temporal division (if desired).
It was created to facilitate the creation of csound scores so the files can be used to render compositions bearing in mind that: p4 is used for volume (normalized between 0-1) and p5 for frequency. Additional p-fields (6 to 16) can be used, if required.
A preview of the score can be heard by mean of the web audio api thus is not necessary to have csound installed.
To use it on a local machine just download it (preserving folders structure) and open the etpr.html file with a web browser (Chrome/Cromium are preferred).


## Bugs/To Do

The software is in working condition but code can be rewritten in a better form. Some bugs can be present.
Feel free to fork and improve it.
